## Contribute

Interested in contributing to Novies? That's great! Due to the app's reliance on external APIs and Firebase for some functionalities, directly running the app with full features might require access to private keys and configuration files which cannot be shared publicly for security reasons.

However, to ensure that you can still contribute effectively, I've prepared mock files that simulate the data and responses you would typically fetch from the server. This approach allows you to work on the app without needing actual API keys or Firebase configuration files.
